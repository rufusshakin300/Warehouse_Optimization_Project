üöÄ Optimizing Warehouse Operations with Power BI üìä
This project focuses on leveraging Power BI to analyze and optimize warehouse space allocation and inventory management. By aligning space utilization with sales performance across product categories, the project aims to improve operational efficiency and drive profitability.

üìÇ Project Overview
Objective
The goal of this project is to evaluate whether the current warehouse space allocation is proportionate to the sales contributions of different product categories and sections, and to identify opportunities for optimization.

üìä Key Features
Space Allocation Analysis

Measure how much space each product category occupies in the warehouse (Space_Allocation_Percentage).
Compare it against the sales contribution percentage (Sales_Percentage).
Highlight misalignments using a custom metric for Space vs. Sales Difference.
Attribution Columns for Granular Insights

Category: Product categories (e.g., Electronics, Furniture).
Section: Warehouse sections (e.g., Refrigerated, Dry Goods).
Warehouse_Location: Specific locations within the warehouse.
These dimensions allow for comparisons across categories, sections, and locations.
Custom Metrics with DAX

Space_Allocation_Percentage: Proportion of warehouse space allocated to each category.
Sales_Percentage: Contribution of each category to overall sales.
Space_Sales_Difference: Difference between space allocation and sales contribution to identify inefficiencies.
Visualizations in Power BI

Clustered Bar Charts: Compare space allocation and sales percentages side-by-side.
Scatter Plots: Highlight alignment or misalignment between space and sales.
Trend Analysis: Use time-series data to uncover seasonal patterns in inventory levels and sales.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques
Power BI:

Designed and implemented interactive dashboards to analyze and visualize data.
Leveraged Power BI‚Äôs analytics pane for trend analysis and forecasting.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):

Created custom measures and calculated columns for precise analysis.
Examples:
Space_Allocation_Percentage:
DAX
Copy code
Space_Allocation_Percentage = 
    DIVIDE(SUM('Sheet1'[Total_Space_Used]), SUMX(ALL('Sheet1'), 'Sheet1'[Total_Space_Used]), 0) * 100
Sales_Percentage:
DAX
Copy code
Sales_Percentage = 
    DIVIDE(SUM('Sheet1'[Total_Revenue]), SUMX(ALL('Sheet1'), 'Sheet1'[Total_Revenue]), 0) * 100
Data Modeling:

Utilized attribution columns like Category, Section, and Warehouse_Location for enhanced granularity.
Applied filters and slicers to drill down into specific time periods and product categories.
üîç Insights
Well-Aligned Categories: Categories with balanced space and sales contributions indicate efficient planning.
Over-Allocated Space: Categories with high space allocation but low sales highlight inefficiencies.
High-Performing Categories: Products with high sales but limited space suggest opportunities for increased allocation.
üìà Future Enhancements
Integration with Forecasting Models: Add predictive analytics to refine space and inventory planning.
Sustainability Metrics: Include environmental impact measures (e.g., energy consumption, waste reduction).
Automation: Automate data refresh and reporting with Power BI‚Äôs scheduled refresh feature.
